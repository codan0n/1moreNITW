    #notes
    #arrive at bakery, angus/gregg welcomes you and invites you to back room. selma is there shuffling cards. she briefly explains the rules of the game and you begin. germ pops in shortly afterwards and joins the game
    
    #can pick up and play every week, selma will summarize the previous session
    
    #major constellation is your class and your ancestor. For the player, this is determined by their species. Determines your abilities and skills.
    #minor constellation is basically your zodiac and gives eithre small buffs, passive bonuses, or a particular skill check
    
    #story revolves around solving a series of murders, reflecting the possum springs cult incident
    #plays similar to disco elysium
    #battles are 4 guys in a row style
    
    #setting is a fantasy magical worth entering its industrial age. dieselpunk/steampunk
    
    #rules of the game: similar to DnD, it's an adventure rpg. Selma handles the stats in the background and guides the story with battles, puzzles, intrigue and mystery. 
    
    #setting: For this session, we live in a world where magic is dying and technological advancements are changing the way people live. Few powerful wizards remain and those that are still alive have had their abilities diminished. It is believed that some sort of far away astronomical event has weakened the planet's connection to magic. The arcane arts are becoming lost now that a new era powered by steam and oil has arrived. The old ways have been forgotten but technology allows for new possibilities even magic couldn't provide. It's a time of opportunity and prosperity... for some. For others, their once simple and peaceful lives have been upturned by greed and war over resources
    
    #story: a string of murders has come to national attention when the old and wise king has been murdered. A group of investigators take to solving the mystery behind the motives and identity of the murderer
    # Bea is appointed as a field investigator to gather clues. Mae is immediately placed under suspicion for her past crimes but Bea clears her name. As thanks, Mae journeys with Bea to solve the mystery.
    # Gregg witnesses a kidnapping that he believes to be related to the murders and is seen by the cultists. Fearing for his life, he asks the adventurer Angus to take him somewhere far away where he'll never be recognized.
    # On their journey, Gregg hires the player for additional protection. As they reach the mountains, they encounter Germ. He has left society to live in the mountains because he was tired of people asking him to communicate with their dead loved ones. He believes that his power causes more death. He also finds it annoying when people ask him to do things.
    #next session, the player scouts ahead and encounters Bea and Mae investigating cult activity in the mountains
