    "Gargoyles adorn the outside while giant pillars and arches frame the murals on the inside."
    "The interior has been modernized with new carpet and a fresh coat of paint that accentuate the comforting dim lighting."
    "You stare at the multitude of books organized neatly on shelves as you walk up to the reception desk. Sitting there is a bear currently writing something down in a notepad."

    "She was the bear you saw at the caf√© the other day!"
    "What did the barista call her?"

    "You feel like you're following a treasure map and slowly piecing together his interests along the way."
    "It's neat seeing what his interests might have been, but it also fills you with remorse for not getting to know him better while he was alive."

    "You get a little nauseous imagining such imagery, but press onward."
    "The story goes on to say that the miners created a secret society from that incident, taking the teeth and passing them down to new members over the years."
