    "Where to now?"
    "There's still another floor to explore. You've just about exhausted your options on this one, so it's time to head up."
    "The elevator rattles louder this time as its doors open and close, making you question just how safe this thing really is."

    stop music fadeout 2.0

    "Apparently safe enough to get you to the third floor in one piece is the answer you get."
    "Dust floats through the air, tickling your nostrils as soon as the elevator doors open."
    "The lighting on this floor is much more subdued, and the walls are painted a dark blue. "
    "You creep forward, wondering if there's anybody up here."
    "It's dead silent save for the sounds of the heating unit. You pass by each aisle and confirm you're alone."
    "Come to think of it, this whole building is pretty empty. It's just you, Selmers, and Lori, each on different floors."
    "Selmers was right about not many people using the library these days."
    "Getting back to the matter at hand, you wonder what the purpose of this floor in particular is."
    "A quick look around reveals that it's for really old media and records."
    "Things like last century's yearbooks, outdated almanacs, newspaper clippings, and even some tomes that remind you of the ones back home."
    "As you're scouting the area, something catches your eye: a big glowing box on one of the desks."
    "It looks like one of those old tube computer monitors, but even bulkier."
    "Warmer, too. You can feel the heat coming off it from a few feet away."
    "This must be one of those microfilm projector things. A microfiche, you think it's called."
    "Someone must have forgotten to turn it off when they used it last."
    "Curious, you take a look at the film that's currently loaded onto it."
    "Seems to be a number of newspaper clippings from decades past. None of them seem all that connected, but a few have some more paranormal themed headlines."
    "None of it is terribly interesting to you, and you're about to look away when one clipping catches your eye."
    "Some story about a tale from the 1800's featuring...miners?"
    "This one actually does intrigue you. You read about an incident where a group of miners took revenge on their exploitative boss, holding him down and forcefully removing his teeth."
    "You get a little nauseous imagining such imagery, but press onward."
    "The story goes on to say that the miners created a secret society from that incident, taking the teeth and passing them down to new members over the years."
    "It finally ends with talking about the members' descendants who occasionally find teeth with strange markings in their home, proving the story's validity."
    "Wow. You know it's just a story from an old newspaper clipping, but you genuinely feel a little unsettled by what you've just read."
    "You flip the power switch off, plunging the room into near total darkness."
    "..."
    "Welp, that about concludes your tour of the library today."
    "You hastily make your way back to the elevator and return to the ground floor. Selmers should have your card ready by now."
